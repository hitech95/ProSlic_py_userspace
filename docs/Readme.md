# Proslic Decoder Documentation

This folder contains documentation and supporting files for the proslic_decoder project.

The project is designed to decode and analyze the initialization sequences and ring sequences from the D2 voice software, as well as provide tools to compare and reimplement these sequences using a custom Proslic driver.

## 📁 Folder Structure

 - `out/`

    Contains the generated results of proslic_decoder. Files here include both human-readable text and machine-readable CSV formats:

    - `out.csv` – CSV version of the initialization sequence generated by the D2 voice software.

    - `python.txt` – Initialization sequence generated by your Proslic driver (re-implementation attempt).

    - `ring_parsed.txt` – Parsed ring sequence from the D2 software (human-readable).

    - `ring.csv` – Machine-readable version of the ring sequence for use in replay attacks.

    - `slic_decodec.txt` – Early human-readable decode of D2’s initialization sequence. This version does not parse RAM operations.

    - `slic_ram_parsed.txt` – Similar to above, but includes parsed RAM operations while skipping "RAM busy" operations.

 - `sequences/`
    
    Contains CSV captures of SPI bus data.

 - `proslic_decoder/`
    
    The decoder software itself.

 - `datasheets/`
    
    The few documents I've used to figure out so far. Proper register and memory description would be awesome to have!

 - `dumps/`
   
   The Logic 2.4 capture files, so you can watch the timings and browse the captured data!

## ⚙️ Setup

The decoder requires Python and the prettytable library. It’s recommended to use a virtual environment.
### Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r proslic_decoder/requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

You can run the decoder module directly.
### Basic usage

Process a file and print a formatted table to stdout:

python -m proslic_decoder.decoder path/to/file.txt

### Options
Option	Description
`-c, --csv <path>`	Output results as CSV to the specified file.
`-X, --raw`	Display registers and memory addresses in hex rather than mnemonics.

### Example 1: Print decoded table to stdout

```bash
python -m proslic_decoder.decoder out/slic_ram_parsed.txt
```

### Example 2: Save output as CSV

```bash
python -m proslic_decoder.decoder out/slic_ram_parsed.txt -c decoded_output.csv
```
### Example 3: Print raw hex addresses (no mnemonics)

```bash
python -m proslic_decoder.decoder out/slic_ram_parsed.txt -X
```

### Example 4: Pipe human-readable table to a file

```bash
python -m proslic_decoder.decoder out/slic_ram_parsed.txt > decoded_output.txt
```

## 📌 Notes

 - When using `-c/--csv`, the output file will contain machine-readable CSV data.

 - Without `-c/--csv`, the table is printed to `stdout` and can be piped to a file.
